  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>A student at <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">RGU</a> who possesses an ever-growing love and fascination for all boughs of software development, be it web, desktop or mobile.</p>
  <p>I'm mainly concerned with the front-end and prefer to handcraft my interfaces. I'm familiar with a broad selection of tools and languages, but consider JavaScript my strongest.</p>
  <p>I typically use NodeJS for my back-end and MongoDB for my database.<br>In my formative days, I used PHP on Apache with MySQL.</p>

      <h3 id="fugro">Fugro</h3>
      <p>Over the summer, I worked in a professional software team for the geo-intelligence company Fugro to help produce user interface components. The UI was built on the Qt framework.</p>
      <p>I was tasked with creating components based on Figma designs. While I primarily used QML, I also made custom implementations of components using C++.</p>
      <p>I also learned to write unit tests, both in QML using QTest and in C++ using gtest.</p>

      <h3 id="attendr">Attendr App</h3>
      <p>Following the hackathon, I was hired by the creators of Attendr to fully develop their interactive app demo.</p>
      <p>The demo depicts the student and lecturer versions of the app and includes tooltips to guide the user through the app. The devices are brought to life with animations powered by JavaScript to enhance the user experience.</p>
      <p>The demo is now in use on the app's <a href="https://attendr.app/">official website</a>.<br>See the demo in action <a href="https://attendr.app/demo/index.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p>I took part in a hackathon event hosted by my university where I and a small team created an interactive marketing demo for a mobile app developed by postgraduates.</p>
      <p>Our team won with the best design.</p>
