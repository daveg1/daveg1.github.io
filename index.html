  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>A student at <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">RGU</a> who possesses an undying love and fascination for all boughs of software development, be it web, desktop or mobile.</p>
  <p>I'm mainly concerned with the front-end and prefer to handcraft my interfaces. I'm familiar with a broad selection of tools and languages, but consider JavaScript my strongest.</p>
  <p>I typically use NodeJS for my back-end and MongoDB for my database.<br>In my formative days, I used PHP on Apache with MySQL.</p>

    <h3 id="fugro">Fugro</h3>
    <p>Over the summer, I worked in a professional software team for the oil company Fugro to help produce a control panel user interface. The UI is intended for specialists operating offshore ROVs and was built on the Qt framework.</p>
    <p>I was tasked with creating QML components from Figma designs and coded primarily in QML, but also created custom components with C++.</p>
    <p>I also learned to write unit tests, both in QML using QTest and in C++ using gtest.</p>

    <h3 id="attendr">Attendr App</h3>
    <p>Following the hackathon, I was invited by the creators of Attendr to produce an interactive demo for their app.</p>
    <p>The demo consists of replicas of the student and lecturer versions of Attendr and are fully interactive. It also includes tooltips to walk the user through the app.</p>
    <p>The owners were pleased with the demo and included it on the app's <a href="https://attendr.app/">official website</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="rgu-hackathon">RGU Hackathon</h3>
    <p>An event hosted by RGU with various tech and software challenges to take part in.</p>
    <p>I joined a team to create a marketing page for an attendance-taking mobile app named Attendr created by undergraduates of RGU.</p>
    <p>In the end, my team took first place and we won some giftcards.</p>
