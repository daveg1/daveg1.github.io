        <h2>Fugro North</h2>
        <p><strong>2020</strong></p>
        <p>During my second year at university, I undertook a student placement for three months at Fugro. Fugro is a geodata company where one area of their business is the manufacture and operation of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). I worked on an embedded-systems project involving a small touchscreen panel for ROV specialists.</p>
        <p>My job entailed creating and testing user interface components using the Qt framework. I learned to make components in QML using the QtQuick 2 library. I also extended existing QML components using C++ to write custom functionality. I then tested my components with QTest in QML and Google Test in C++.</p>
        <p>While on placement, I observed how a professional software team manages a project. The team used an agile approach, which introduced me to epics, sprint meetings and the Jira issue-tracking software. I also engaged in daily scrum meetings where I practised my communication with my peers.</p>

        <h2>Attendr</h2>
        <p><strong>2019</strong></p>
        <p>After winning a Hackathon event, postgraduates at my university hired me to develop a web-based demo for their mobile app Attendr.</p>
        <p>Attendr is an attendance-taking app marketed towards higher-learning institutions and consists of two versions: student and lecturer. The owners wanted an interactive demo that illustrated the attendance process, as well as the various features of the apps. </p>
        <p>I used their designs to recreate each app's interface in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and created a way to highlight the features using tooltips. Furthermore, to make the app more lively, I incorporated animations written in JavaScript, including screen swipes and fade-outs.</p>
        <p>The final result was well-received and is now live on the official Attendr website.</p>

        <h2>RGU Hackathon</h2>
        <p><strong>2019</strong></p>
        <p>I attended a Hackathon event hosted by my university and entered a challenge where you had 24 hours to create the best-looking marketing page for a mobile app. The app was created by postgraduates of RGU who wanted an interactive, lifelike version of their app on a webpage.</p>
        <p>I joined a small group to help design and implement the page. I created the webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and used Git to save commits to our team's GitHub repository. After the challenge concluded, we won with the best webpage.</p>
