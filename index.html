  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>A student at RGU who possesses an undying love and fascination for software development, be it web, desktop or mobile.</p>
  <p>My primary concern is in the front-end â€” I love producing user interfaces. I am familiar with a broad selection of tools and languages, but consider my strongest to be JavaScript.</p>
  <p>I typically use NodeJS for my back-end and MongoDB for my database. In my formative days, I used PHP on Apache with MySQL.</p>

    <h3>Fugro</h3>
    <p>Over the summer, I worked in a software team to help produce a control panel user interface. The control panel is for specialists operating offshore ROVs.</p>
    <p>The UI was built on the Qt framework and I spent 2 months coding in QML and C++ in a Linux environment.</p>

    <h3>Attendr App</h3>
    <p>Following the hackathon, I was invited by the creators of Attendr to produce an interactive demo for their app.</p>
    <p>The demo consists of replicas of the student and lecturer versions of Attendr and are fully interactive. It also includes tooltips to walk the user through the app.</p>
    <p>The owners were pleased with the demo and included it on the app's <a href="https://attendr.app/">official website</a>.</p>

    <h3>RGU Hackathon</h3>
    <p>An event hosted by RGU with various tech and software challenges to take part in.</p>
    <p>I joined a team to create a marketing page for an attendance-taking mobile app named Attendr created by undergraduates of RGU.</p>
    <p>In the end, my team took first place and we won some giftcards.</p>
